This repository contains two Python tasks:

1. **Recursive File Search** : A program that recursively searches for a file within a directory and its subdirectories.
2. **Permutation Generation** : A program that generates all permutations of a given string using both recursive and iterative approaches and compares their performance.

## Task 1: Recursive File Search

The `Task1.py` script recursively searches for a specified file within a directory and its subdirectories. The accompanying test suite, `TestTask1.py`, verifies the program's functionality. A batch script (`make.bat`) automates the process, including error logging.

### Files

* **Task1.py** : Main script for recursive file search.
* **TestTask1.py** : Unit tests for `Task1.py`.
* **make.bat** : Windows batch script to automate execution of `Task1.py` and the test suite.
* **test_report.log** : Log file generated by `make.bat`, capturing test results and errors.

### Usage

#### Running the Main Program

The program accepts up to three arguments:

1. **Directory Path** (required): Starting directory for the search.
2. **File Name** (optional): Name of the file to search for.
3. **Additional Option** (optional): Any other parameter as needed.

##### Command:

```shell
make.bat <directory_path> <file_name> [additional_option]
```

* Errors and test results are saved in `test_report.log`.

#### Running the Test Suite

Run tests separately with:


```shell
python -m unittest .\TestTask1.py
```

## Task 2: Permutation Generation and Performance Comparison

The `Task2.py` script generates all possible permutations of a given string, supporting both recursive and iterative approaches. It also includes performance comparison for both methods and provides an option to remove duplicate permutations.

### Functions

* **generate_permutations** : Recursive function to generate permutations.
* **generate_permutations_iterative** : Iterative function for permutations.
* **compare_performance** : Compares execution time between recursive and iterative methods.
* **run_tests** : Runs predefined test cases to validate functionality.

### Usage

Run the script directly:

```shell
python Task2.py
```

This will:

1. Generate and print permutations for test cases in `run_tests`.
2. Compare performance of both recursive and iterative methods on the string "ABCD".

### Example Output

For the input string `"ABC"`, the program outputs:

```plaintext
Generated 6 permutations: ['ABC', 'ACB', 'BAC', 'BCA', 'CAB', 'CBA']
Performance comparison for string 'ABCD':
Recursive approach: 0.000512 seconds
Iterative approach: 0.000423 seconds
Number of permutations: 24
Results match: True
```

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Linux OS
